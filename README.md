## Project Summary:
This capstone project is provided by Arvato Financial Solutions for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. 

This capstone project contains three parts:

1. **Customer Segmentation Report**
This customer demographics are analyzed by unsupervised learning techniques to describe the relationship between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population of Germany and compare parts of the general population that are more likely to be part of the mail-order company's main customer base. 

2. **Supervised Learning Model** 
Based on the customer demographics analysis, we build a supervised learning model that predicts whether or not it will be worth it to include that person in the campaign.

3. **Kaggle Competition**
we test the supervised learning model in competition through Kaggle to make predictions on the campaign data and see how it measures up to the other solutions.
